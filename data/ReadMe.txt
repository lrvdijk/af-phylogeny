CMB2015 Final Assignment Data


File: 	  01_real_sequences.fasta
Remarks:
	This file contains 144 ACTG-sequences of real organisms
	in fasta format.



File:	  02_synthetic_sequences_mc.paml
Remarks: 
	This file contains 8 x 100 synthetic ACTG-sequences of length 900
	generated using the 'evolver' program of PAML. 
        The example file MCBase.dat of PAML has been adapted and
 	saved as MyMCBase.dat. This file is then used as input of 
	the 'evolver' program:

	>> evolver 5 MyMCBase.dat

	Note: The Win32 executables of PAML work from the command prompt
        of Windows 7 64-bit.

File:	srep06504.pdf
Remarks:
	The original paper of C.X. Chan et al. on AF-free phylogenetics.
	This paper contains much of the details of M.A. Ragan's talk and 
	presentation.
